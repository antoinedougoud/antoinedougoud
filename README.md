## Hi there! I'm ðŸ‘‹  

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on microscopy techniques (STM, TEM, STEM) and computational physics, focusing on low-temperature STM and UHV systems.  
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning spectroscopy techniques, numerical simulations, and advanced LaTeX for scientific reports.  
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects related to scientific computing, microscopy, and physics simulations.  
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with optimizing thermalization time in STM design and improving my Python simulations.  
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about materials science, microscopy, Anki for efficient studying, and historical research on Swiss printing houses.  
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Through GitHub!  
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him  
- âš¡ Fun fact: I like studying in botanical gardens and diving into historical archives just as much as coding physics simulations!
